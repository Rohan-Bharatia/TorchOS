# Code of Conduct
This Code of Conduct ensures a welcoming environment for all participants and addresses specific considerations for a TorchOS project, such as safety, resource sharing, and supporting learning. It sets clear expectations and provides guidelines for maintaining a positive and productive community.

Please read the following as an example of what to do and not do:

## Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards
Examples of positive behaviours include:
 * Using welcoming and inclusive language.
 * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
 * Gracefully accept constructive criticism.
 * Focusing on what's best for the community.
 * Showing empathy and kindness to all other contributers, regardless of tier.
 * Celebrating the acheivments and innovations of fellow contributors.

Examples of negative behaviours include:
 * The use of sexualized/derogatory/political/innapropriate based language, imagery, advances, trolling or harrasment comments will be dealt with a permanent ban.
 * Publishing private information such as physical or electronic adresses without explicit written or spoken conformation will be dealt with a permanent ban.

## Responsibilities
Project contributors are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project contributors have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with the [Code of Conduct](#standards), or to ban permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This [Code of Conduct](#standards) applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing our project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project contributors.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at any collaborator. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the [Code of Conduct](#standards) in good faith may face permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the projectâ€™s leadership.
